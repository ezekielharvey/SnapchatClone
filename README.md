## About

This Snapchat Clone is a basic version of the actual Snapchat app. In this version there is fully implemented Authentication through 
firebase authentication. There is Camera capability so you are able to take pictures and save them to your media library. Messaging is
implemented so you're allowed to text another user on the application. Map capability is implemented also, so you will be able to see your
location on the map. This application was developed with react native, so you are able to run the app on both iOS and Android.
